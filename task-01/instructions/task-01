Task 1

Conduct non-equilibrium simulation on the given system

System:
VE-ST with 95% conversion and k = 0.3

MD simulation procedures

1. Conduct a 5ns NPT simulation at 300K
2. Conduct non-equilibrium simulations(NEMD) along x, y and z directions
   -- All simulations under 300K
   -- NEMD should stretch the box up to 10% strain, calculate the simulation base on this strain
   -- Correct setting the mdp file
3. Extract the data from MD simulations energy file and do the analysis

Results:

1. For step 1, plot the temperature vs. time, total energy vs. time and volume vs. time
2. For step 2, all directions simulation, plot the strain length vs. time
3. For step 3, using python generate the stress vs. strain curve. Inside the graph, besides thestress, strain data point, also include the linear fit line using data within 2% strain, calculate the slope of the linear line. Insert the note to the graph, which shows the young's modulus you estimate. Do the same thing for three directions.
