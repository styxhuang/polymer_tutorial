Using Molecular Dynamic(MD) simulation to estimate system glass transition temperature (Tg)
Author: Ming Huang

Before you start this tutorial, some terms you need to check online and get understand:
-- Glass transition temperature (Tg) 
   -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition
-- Simulated annealing protocol (GROMACS)
   -- http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2019/reference-manual/algorithms/simulated-annealing.html

In this tutorial, you need to finish the following tasks:
--> Equilibrate initial structure 'eql.gro'
--> Simple annealing MD simulation
--> Annealing simulation tests
--> A complete annealing simulation
--> Analyze the relation between system volume and temperature

Detailed procedures:
1. Equilibrate initial structure 'eql.gro'
-- Same as we have done before

2. Simple annealing MD simualtion
-- Using the well equilibrated structure, and 'anneal-1.mdp' to start the annealing simulation
-- After the simulation is finished, extract the volume and temperature from the energy file
-- Generate the figures: volume vs time, temperature vs time, volume vs temperature

3. Annealing test
# Multiple loop, forget the criteria how many loop we need to remove the internal pressure of the structure

4. A complete annealing simulation
-- Using the well equilibrated structure, and 'anneal-2.mdp' to start the annealing simulation
-- Plot the figures as we decribed in step 2.
-- Analyze the results
