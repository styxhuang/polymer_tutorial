Basic knowledge to start project

To start this project, following softwares may need
-- Linux environment text editor
  -- vim, emacs, etc.

-- Linux environment plot software
  -- gnuplot, python, matlab, etc. (Exclude Excel)

-- Programing languages may need
  -- UNIX (bash script)
  -- python3

-- Molecular simulation engine
  -- GROMACS

-- Visualization software
  -- VMD, AVOGADRO

Softwares like, vim, gnuplot, VMD, AVOGADRO, can be learned during the project. 

GROMACS

Do the following tutorial to get a basic understand about molecular dynamic simulation and GROMACS (Tutorial details please check 'http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/index.html')
This tutorial simulate the behavior of the lysozyme in the water which also neutralize with ions

This tutorial needs to pay attention on the following things:
-- All GROMACS command can get its help document by 'gmx $COMMAND -h'
-- Understand the following terms definition
  -- forcefield
  -- Energy minimization/NVT simulation/NPT simulation/NVE simulation
  
-- Understand the GROMACS file format (Details can check the GROMACS manual v2016.2)
  -- structure file (.gro) and topology file (.top, .itp)

-- Setup system
  -- Grap protein from protein data base (PDB)
  -- Using pdb2gmx convert .pdb to .gro file 
  -- Put the protein (.gro) in the middle of the box, put water inside of the box, and assign ions to neutralize the system

-- Conduct different types of simulation
  -- Energy minimization (EM), NVT, NPT

-- Using VMD to visualize the system's trajectory
  -- Open VMD from terminal
  -- Load protein .gro file
  -- Load .trr/.xtc file to the .gro file
  -- In the 'Representation' options (Graphics --> Representations), create three groups ('Protein', 'ions', 'system') which only contain relative atoms
  -- Visualize the protein/water behavior

-- Analyze energy file
  -- EM
    -- Understand what EM simulation is doing 
    -- Analyze the potential energy
  -- NVT
    -- Understand what NVT simulation is doing
    -- Analyze the potential energy, volume, temperature 
  -- NPT
    -- Understand what NPT simulation is doing
       -- Read the manual what is pressure coupling method and how to control it
    -- Analyze the potential energy, volume, pressure, temperature
  -- Compare the energy term of different types of simulation

-- Using Gnuplot or python3 or matlab to plot different energy terms vs. time

Optional task
-- Conduct an NVE simulation (constant number of particle, volume, energy)
   -- Understand the concept of NVE simulation
   -- Analyze the system's potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy
   -- Compare the energy plot with NVT, NPT simulations and try to understand the difference
