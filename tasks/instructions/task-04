Task 3

Calculate systems Young's modulus and take average of all replicas

Goal

These systems are partially cured at first and all free styrene molecules are removed. You need to measure these system's Young's modulus

System

All systems you can find under the folder "/home/ming/ming/model/315VE-1020STY/del-sys/wo-VE-del". Copy all the contents to your folder. And this time, you just need to measure the E of systems which k=0.5 (Systems in k0.5 folder). 

MD simulation procedures

1. Since all these systems are just cured. You need to release the internal stress of the system. So you need a 5ns 800K NPT simulations and followed by a 2ns 260K NPT simulations
2. After above step, you can obtain a well equilibrated structure. Use this structure to measure the Young's modulus as you did before.
3. Repeat above steps for all replicas.

This time the system size is relative big. You need to submit these jobs to proteus. Under this folder there is a proteus script "sub". Please modified it with you needed. More about the script please read the document on this site: https://proteusmaster.urcf.drexel.edu/urcfwiki/index.php/Writing_Job_Scripts

There is a 48 hours time limit for each job you submit to the proteus. I suggest you need to estimate the efficiency of you simulation by running a short NPT simulation test first. Then calculate how much time you need. Proteus has a priority algorithm, you need to make sure the wall time should be similar as you calculated. 

Results

1. Show the average Young's modulus of all systems.
